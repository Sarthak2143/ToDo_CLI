# CLI ToDo Application

The application has a user-friendly CLI that allows you to set up the to-do database. Once there, you can add, remove, and complete to-dos using appropriate commands, arguments, and options. If you ever get stuck, then you can ask for help using the `--help` option with proper arguments.
